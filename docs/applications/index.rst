Applications
==========================================

This section covers the documentation of the individual parts of our ÂµRaiden framework.
We deliver Python implementations for the payment-receiver side in general as well as for the payment-sender side
in a M2M (Machine-to-Machine) or IoT (Internet-of-Things) setup. For user-facing web applications,
we provide a JavaScript implementation to directly serve the payment-senders logic to the customer.
