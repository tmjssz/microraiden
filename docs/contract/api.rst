.. _Auto-Generated-API: https://github.com/raiden-network/microraiden/blob/master/docs/contract/RaidenMicroTransferChannels.md

There is an Auto-Generated-API_, that is compiled with `soldocs`.


Prerequisites

::

    pip install soldocs
    populus compile
    soldocs --input build/contracts.json --output docs/contract/RaidenMicroTransferChannels.md --contracts RaidenMicroTransferChannels


Opening a transfer channel
---------------------------

ERC223 compatible (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sender sends tokens to the Contract, with a payload for calling
``createChannelPrivate``.

::

    Token.transfer(_to, _value, _data)

Gas cost (testing): 88976

-  ``_to`` = ``Contract.address``
-  ``_value`` = deposit value (number of tokens)
-  ``_data`` contains the Sender and Receiver addresses encoded in 20 bytes
-  in python ``_data = bytes.fromhex(sender_address[2:] + receiver_address[2:])``

.. figure:: diagrams/ChannelOpen_223.png

ERC20 compatible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: py

    # approve token transfers to the contract from the Sender's behalf
    Token.approve(contract, deposit)

    Contract.createChannel(receiver_address, deposit)

Gas cost (testing): 120090

.. figure:: diagrams/ChannelOpen_20.png

Topping up a channel
---------------------

Adding tokens to an already opened channel.

ERC223 compatible (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sender sends tokens to the Contract, with a payload for calling
``topUp``.

::

    Token.transfer(_to, _value, _data)

Gas cost (testing): 54885

-  ``_to`` = ``Contract.address``
-  ``_value`` = deposit value (number of tokens)
-  ``_data`` contains the Sender and Receiver addresses encoded in 20 bytes + the
   open\_block\_number in 4 bytes
-  in python

.. code:: py

    _data = sender_address[2:] + receiver_address[2:] + hex(open_block_number)[2:].zfill(8)
    _data = bytes.fromhex(_data)

.. figure:: diagrams/ChannelTopUp_223.png

ERC20 compatible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: py

    #approve token transfers to the contract from the Sender's behalf
    Token.approve(contract, added_deposit)

    # open_block_number = block number at which the channel was opened
    Contract.topUp(receiver_address, open_block_number, added_deposit)

Gas cost (testing): 85414

.. _contract-validate-balance-proof:

Generating and validating a balance proof
------------------------------------------

(to be updated post EIP712)

.. code:: python


    # Sender has to provide a balance proof to the Receiver when making a micropayment
    # The contract implements some helper functions for that

    # Balance message
    bytes32 balance_message_hash = keccak256(
        keccak256(
            'string message_id',

            address(this)
        )
    );

    # balance_message_hash is signed by the Sender with MetaMask
    balance_msg_sig

    # Data is sent to the Receiver (receiver, open_block_number, balance, balance_msg_sig)

.. _contract-validate-close:

Generating and validating a closing agreement
----------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

    from eth_utils import encode_hex

    # Sender has to provide a balance proof to the Contract and
    # a closing agreement proof from Receiver (closing_sig)
    # closing_sig is created in the same way as balance_msg_sig, but it is signed by the Receiver

    # Closing signature message
    bytes32 balance_message_hash = keccak256(
        keccak256(
            'string message_id',
            'address sender',

            address(this)
        )
    );

    # balance_message_hash is signed by the Sender with MetaMask
    balance_msg_sig

    # balance_msg_sig is signed by the Receiver inside the microraiden code
    closing_sig

    # Send to the Contract (example of collaborative closing, transaction sent by Sender)

Balance proof / closing agreement signature verification:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python


    sender_address = Contract.call().extractBalanceProofSignature(receiver_address, open_block_number, balance, balance_msg_sig)

    receiver_address = Contract.call().extractClosingSignature(sender_address, open_block_number, balance, closing_sig)

.. _contract-closing-a-channel:

Closing a channel
------------------

.. code:: py

    # 1. Receiver calls Contract with the sender's signed balance message = instant close & settle
    # 2. Client calls Contract with receiver's closing signature = instant close & settle
    # Gas cost (testing): 71182
    Contract.cooperativeClose(receiver_address, open_block_number, balance, balance_msg_sig, closing_sig)

    # 3. Client calls Contract without receiver's closing signature = challenge period starts, channel is not settled yet
    # Gas cost (testing): 53876
    Contract.uncooperativeClose(receiver_address, open_block_number, balance)

    # 3.a. During the challenge period, 1. can happen.

    # 3.b. Client calls Contract after settlement period ends
    # Gas cost (testing): 40896
    Contract.settle(receiver_address, open_block_number)
